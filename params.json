{"name":"The S16 library","tagline":"Library of infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies calibrated on the deepest Herschel images","body":"# Short description\r\n\r\nThis is a library of model infrared spectra of galaxies, calibrated on the deepest Herschel images in the CANDELS fields (see Schreiber et al. 2016 for more information). These are based on the physically-motivated dust model of [Galliano et al. (2011)], using amorphous carbon grains.\r\n\r\nThe library is composed of two files: 's16_dust.fits' which contains the dust continuum templates created by big grains, and 's16_pah.fits' which contains the mid-infrared features coming from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). Each file contains the same number of templates (200), each corresponding to a different intensity of the interstellar radiation field (<U>) or, equivalently, to a different dust temperature (Tdust). These templates correspond to the luminosity (expressed in units of the solar luminosity) emitted by a cloud of dust of mass equal to one solar mass. The big grain and PAH templates can be co-added with an arbitrary weight (fPAH) to form a full dust spectrum.\r\n\r\n# How to get it?\r\n\r\nYou can get the library either by cloning the git repository:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cschreib/ifni.git\r\n```\r\nor by downloading .tgz or .zip archives from this page.\r\n\r\n# How to use it?\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the usage of this library, two [IDL]/[GDL] scripts are provided. The first, 'get_s16_template.pro', will create a new spectrum given Tdust and fPAH. The second, 'get_s16_template_calib.pro', will use the calibrated evolution of Tdust and fPAH with redshift (plus an additional, optional dependence on the Main Sequence offset) that is published in the paper. Therefore it will create a spectrum based solely on the redshift. Further documentation is available in each file.\r\n\r\nLastly, an example IDL/GDL script ('example.pro') is provided to show how the above procedures can be used, and to illustrate the features of the library.\r\n\r\n[Galliano et al.
